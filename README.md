# Dotnet Cyberpunk Challenge 3.14 (Homework)
This repo is the homework extension of the [dotnet-cyberpunk-challenge-3]() which further extends the ideas of Generics, abstracts, etc., by putting the pressure on you guys to create a generic version of the Biotechnica variant of the `KuangPrimusMalware`. The challenges begin execution at `Handler.cs::StartTheChallenges()`.

You can find the instructions to get started at [Getting Started](./docs/GettingStarted.md)
